# Getting Started with Android Malware Analysis

The Android operating system has been around since 2008 and has also been open source from the beginning.
Leaving things open source allows for a lot of apps to slide thru the cracks when it comes to security.
At one point a flashlight app made the news for stealing user information when all it was 
suppose to do is turn on the camera light. This small incident has sparked tools that allow one 
to get into android malware analysis.
To my knowledge there is not a set tool that developers can use to make sure that their 
application can’t be exploited. I spent years studying and building malware and now would like 
to help others to get into the malware analysis side in hopes that a general tool can be made 
for check applications before being published for consumer use. I’ll take you thru setting up 
your environment and analyzing a controlled application apk. At the end of the talk you should 
leave excited to look more into Android malware analysis and the Android system as a whole.

TLDR: I’m talking about looking for security holes in Android apps
